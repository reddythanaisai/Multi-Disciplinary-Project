This multidisciplinary project focuses on developing an intelligent face detection system using Python. The system uses computer vision techniques to detect human faces in real-time through a webcam or image input. Python libraries like OpenCV are used to extract facial features, identify face regions, and draw bounding boxes around detected faces. This project combines concepts from multiple domains such as programming, image processing, artificial intelligence, and mathematics. The primary goal is to demonstrate how machines can analyse visual data and take actions based on it. This system can be further expanded for applications like attendance systems, security monitoring, and identity verification in future enhancements.
